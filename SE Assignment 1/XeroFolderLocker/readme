Xero Folder Locker(MVC)
------------------

folder locker, a system tool that enable us to lock our secret files and folders within seconds.
c# is the platform to develop this application, it uses MVC architectural design pattern for the
windows form application(WF).

why i prefer MVC?
----------------
since at the begining i didnt know more about the logics behind the folder lock,
so i start by developing the view part only and then after i got some principles and the meaning of locking,
i wrote the model and the controller part.so basically MVC lets us to focus only on one part with out considering
other parts(separation of concern).
